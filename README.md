# Xtern-Data-Science-work-sample-assessment

Summary: Overall, I would like to finish the research and fill up the information as following for all 5 locations. I was not able to finish them all due to limited of time. I plan to analysis the data by using the R to do the data visulization for the distance and rating of all 5 locations for these 50 restarant to see if I can draw some conclusion from that. I plan also do the samething to the bi-weekly event for all 5 locations. After doing the data visulization, I think I can draw a conclusion of which location is most sutible for this project.
